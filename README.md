This is a desktop game called **Snake Pit** inspired by the 1995 classic [Achtung, die Kurve!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!) It was built using third-party WebGL framework [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), (vanilla) JavaScript, CSS and HTML. All of the code in this project was developed together by Jesper Lundqvist and Dominic Kersch using either Discord screen-sharing or pair programming methods.

## About This Project
* Snake Pit is a multiplayer snake game which supports 2-4 players. 
* Choose the number of players, enter your players' names as well as a target number of rounds. 
* Win rounds by being the last remaining snake to avoid collision with other snake tails (or your own).
* Each snake's tail will periodically leave a gap which, used tactfully, can be used to pass through another snake.
* The first player to defeat all other opponents by two rounds after reaching the target wins the game.
